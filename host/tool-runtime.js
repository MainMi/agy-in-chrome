// which Chrome starts and stops with the extension, so this process never has
// to own anything, elect anything, or care who else is attached.
//
// It used to be far more than this: every consumer raced to bind a TCP port,
// and the winner multiplexed all the others through itself. That made an
// ordinary AGY session load-bearing for the whole machine. All of it —
// the election, the yield protocol, the peer-classification sniff, the
// self-promotion path, the pidfile — existed to manage a role nobody should
// have had, and went away with it.
//
// This used to live inline in mcp-server.js; it's extracted so that other
// in-process consumers (the codemode + hybrid servers) can call tools
// without going through a child mcp-server.js + stdio MCP roundtrip.
